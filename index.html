            Music and Musical Instruments addiction on adults, teenagers, and kids alike. Welcome to my page! I created this page to
            talk more about the negative side that music could create in us. It is important that we understand this along with implementing
            it in our daily lives. Through this journey, we'll be exploring the downsides, benefits, and the power of music.

            which can lead to various different problems or consequences. I felt that I needed to do this because it's concerning.
