                        Music and Musical Instruments addiction on adults, teenagers, and kids alike. Welcome to my page! I created this page to
                        talk more about the negative side that music could create in us. It is important that we understand this along with implementing
                        it in our daily lives. The most addicted music individuals are the teens because these are the individuals who are more susceptible to music than
                        other age groups. Along with that, some individuals are just addicted to music in some or the other ways which include listening to too many songs in one day,
                        spending too much time only for this activity, and much more. Throughout this journey, we'll be exploring many of these downsides of music which some people
                        believe do not exist and that's not true. 
                        
                        I would like to explain a small story from my life of how music impacted my life in both a positive and a negative
                        way. It was during Covid, this all started. I was sitting at home doing nothing and one of my mom's colleague's son
                        asked my mom if he could get somebody to teach guitar. He was also sitting at home bored and finally, I started taking
                        guitar classes from him. In this manner, I brought a new guitar, which was at that time, my first ever guitar. And, then
                        I started showing interest in it and slowly, I started mastering the guitar. In this way, during the first half of the Covid time,
                        I spent most of the time playing along with songs on guitar and so on. And then, I joined the guitar sessions in my high school in the US. And afterwards,
                        when I got to the Mount, I just got addicted to music and it impacted me in a negative way by affecting my studies and so on.
                        For this reason, I created this page! For more information, check out my other pages as well!
